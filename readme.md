Jonathan Arístides Viracachá Martínez
Systems engineer with experience in application and information systems management, as well as process monitoring and validation on Unix operating systems. I have skills in support and maintenance of solutions that include languages ​​such as Java, Shell, and Visual Basic. I also have a solid command of Oracle SQL for database management, in addition to skills in data analysis and Big Data. My focus is on diagnosing and resolving technical issues, automating critical processes, and providing efficient support in business environments. I have contributed to the development of robust systems and the optimization of workflows through scalable, results-oriented technological solutions. I am interested in continuing to apply my knowledge of data analysis and emerging technologies to support companies in their strategic decision-making..
